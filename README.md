## Preambule

Have you ever encountered a situation where your Spring REST resources needed to be queried
in tons of different ways? Making you provide a massive number of Repository query methods,
and most probably different endpoints. Or even a bunch of `@RequestParam`'s and combined in
`COALESCE` calls. **Requery** aims to solve this struggle by providing a conversion between
a generic HTTP Request and a desired query while maintaining the security underneath.

## Table of Contents

* [Preambule](#preambule)
* [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
* [Features](#features)
* [Quick Start](#quick-start)

## Features

* **Dynamic Query Generation:** Create complex queries from HTTP requests dynamically.
* **Flexible Filtering:** Use the provided `FilterJsonArgumentResolver` to handle JSON based filtering.
* **Enum Handling:** Map enums to database columns seamlessly with `JoinColumnEnumeration`.

## Quick Start

**Add Maven Dependency**

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>bg.codexio.springframework.data.jpa.requery</groupId>
    <artifactId>requery-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

**Requery** is designed to simplify the dynamic generation of queries from HTTP requests in Spring MVC applications.
Hereâ€™s how you can integrate and utilize the key components of the library:

### Configuration

To leverage the `FilterJsonArgumentResolver` and other components, you need to set up several beans in your Spring
configuration:

#### Register the argument resolver:

```java

@Configuration
public class FilterJsonArgumentResolverConfiguration
        implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    private final FilterJsonArgumentResolver filterJsonArgumentResolver;

    public FilterJsonArgumentResolverConfiguration(FilterJsonArgumentResolver filterJsonArgumentResolver) {
        this.filterJsonArgumentResolver = filterJsonArgumentResolver;
    }

    @Override
    public void addArgumentResolvers(List<HandlerMethodArgumentResolver> resolvers) {
        resolvers.add(this.filterJsonArgumentResolver);
    }
}
```

### Hibernate dialect configuration

Since `Requery` may optimize SQL queries differently based on the database type. Currently, we support two dialect
extensions - MySQL and PostgreSQL

Add the Hibernate dialect setting in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` as follows:

#### For MySQL:

```properties
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=bg.codexio.springframework.data.jpa.requery.resolver.function.ExtendedMysqlDialect
```

#### For PostgreSQL:

```properties
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=bg.codexio.springframework.data.jpa.requery.resolver.function.ExtendedPostgresqlDialect
```

### Basic Usage in a Controller

After setting up your configuration, you can use the `FilterJsonArgumentResolver` in your controllers to dynamically
construct queries based on JSON input:

```java

@RestController
public class MyController {

    private final MyEntityRepository myEntityRepository;

    public MyController(MyEntityRepository myEntityRepository) {
        this.myEntityRepository = myEntityRepository;
    }

    @GetMapping("/my-entities")
    public ResponseEntity<List<MyEntity>> getMyEntities(Specification<MyEntity> spec) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(myEntityRepository.findAll(spec));
    }
}
```

This setup enables your Spring application to interpret JSON filter parameters directly from request queries and convert
them into JPA specifications

## Contributing

This project could use a support and contributors are very welcomed. If you feel that something has to be
changed or a bug to be fixed, you can report a [new issue](https://github.com/CodexioLtd/spring-requery/issues/new), and
we can take care of it.

If you want to submit directly a code fix, we will be more than glad to see it. Fork the repository and start a clean
branch out of the version you want to patch. When you are finished, make sure all your tests are passing and the
coverage remains in decent level by executing `mvn clean test jacoco:report -Pmvn-deploy`.

Please use the [code style](./codestyle.xml)
in the project root folder. If your IDE does not support it, we strongly encourage you just to follow
the code styling in the rest of the classes and methods.

After all, your tests are passing and the coverage seems good to you, create a
[pull request](https://github.com/CodexioLtd/spring-requery/compare). We will review the request and either leave
some meaningful suggestions back or maybe merge it and release it with the next release.
